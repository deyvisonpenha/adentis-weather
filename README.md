# Weather

This project was developed in ReactJs to a interview when I developed a weather system for regions in Portugal, to view precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature. 

### For this challenge I used:
 * ReactJs 
 * styled-components
 * Weather API

### Hooks as:
* useContext, 
* useEffect and 
* useState
